        Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist known for being the
        inventor of the World Wide Web. Also referred to as W3 or WWW.
        Berners-Lee worked for CERN in 1980 which is a particle physics
        laboratory in Geneva. (Tim Berners-Lee | Biography, Education, Internet,
        Contributions, & Facts, 2022) The reading of the World Wide Web was
        highly fascinating to read as it extended for me the first lecture about
        HTML fundamentals. The reading gives a deeper understanding and
        background about HTML, URL, HTTP/S, servers, and clients. According to
        Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web was created so that scholars or writers
        could share their work with each other from different locations without
        having to send it through e-mail. (Berners-Lee et al., 1994) text of the
        World Wide Web starts off by looking into the W3 client program which
        runs on an individual’s computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        A client program is any computer hardware or software device from which
        a person will request access to a service or information which is
        provided by a server. (Gillis, 2021) An example of a client program
        would be a web browser that connects to a web server (a completely
        different machine possibly in another part of the world) that will then
        display web pages as requested. (Wikipedia contributors, 2022) The
        requested information will then present itself either as hypertext,
        plain text, or multimedia format. The text highlights some important
        points such as that no matter the server the user interface is the same,
        links can direct to anything that can be displayed and there are many W3
        client programs. (Berners-Lee et al., 1994)
      </p>
      <p>
        The article also defines World Wide Web through a series of points that
        state that the World Wide Web is the idea of limitless information world
        where all items have a reference by which they can be retrieved, markup
        language (HTML) which e very W3 client should understand, a network
        protocol (HTTP), the address system (URI) and finally the data available
        on the internet available using the above-listed items. Universal
        Resource identifiers (URIs) are short strings containing a name or
        address which indicates an object on the web for example menus or
        images. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol for
        transferring hypermedia documents such as HTML, it was designed for
        communication between web browsers and web servers. According to the
        article “HTTP is used for retrieving documents in an unbounded and
        extensible set of formats. To achieve this, the client sends a list of
        the formats it can handle, and the server replies with data in any of
        those formats that it can produce”. (Berners-Lee et al., 1994 p794)
        Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for websites
        used to describe the structure of a website it allows authors to publish
        online documents with headings, pictures, texts, lists, etc (Berners-Lee
        et al., 1994)
      </p>
      <p>
        The one thing that stood out the most for me in this reading was when
        Berners said that “technology doesn’t have to be the best but good
        enough”. (Berners-Lee et al., 1994) And this leads me to think about all
        forms of software such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and Twitter. These might
        not be extremely the best but are good apps and have millions if not
        billions of users. All of which I would consider are good types of
        software and have a good user interface. Berners-Lee mentions that
        “technology does not have to be expensive, but it can dominate in other
        ways”. (Berners-Lee et al., 1994)
      </p>
      <p>
        And that brings me to think about a simple website I can create that
        didn’t cost me anything but is a good website. But also, this depends on
        what exactly makes a good website besides a good user interface. As
        Berners mentions is that “a user doesn’t have to have an extensive
        knowledge about the interface to be able to use it”. (Berners-Lee et
        al., 1994) And I did notice that the longer you spend on the internet or
        the Web you can seemingly use any form or website if you have interacted
        with another, the navigation becomes easier. I can navigate through most
        websites because of that, websites are similar in how to navigate
        through them.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the article, Berners-Lee mentions what is expected from
        the future in terms of technology and software. Such as “virtual
        reality, teleconferencing, the ability for companies to create websites
        for-profit and to be able to find documents based on their names”.
        (Berners-Lee et al., 1994 p797) And it is amazing to see how the ideas
        or thoughts put out by Berner are now a reality. Lol such as virtual
        reality and teleconferencing apps such as Skype, Zoom, and
        BigBlueButton. (Boyarsky, n.d.) Business websites and now we also have
        online shopping to the likes of sites such as Shein which is a Chinese
        online fast retailer. (Wikipedia contributors, 2022b) And I would assume
        these are the kind of things that Berner wanted to see prepared out of
        the World Wide Web.
