    <p class="one">
      World Wide Web According to research Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer
      scientist known for being the inventor of the World Wide Web. Also
      referred to as W3 or WWW. Berners-Lee worked for CERN in 1980 which is a
      particle physics laboratory in Geneva. The reading of the World Wide Web
      was highly fascinating to read as it extended for me the first lecture
      about HTML fundamentals. The reading gives a deeper understanding and
      background about HTML, URL, HTTP/S, servers and clients. According to
      Berners-Lee the World Wide Web was created so that scholars or writers
      could share their work amongst each other from different locations without
      having to send it through e-mail. </p>
      <p class="one">The one thing that stood out the most
      for me in this reading was when Berners said that the “technology doesn’t
      have to be the best but good enough”. And this leads me to think about all
      forms of software such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Twitter. Which might not
      be extremely the best but are good apps and have millions of not billions
      of users. All of which I would consider are good foes of software and jab
      an good user interface. Berners-Lee mentions that “technology does not
      have to be expensive but it can dominate in other ways”. And that brings
      me to think about simple websites that developers create that probably
      wouldn’t cost any money but because it is user friendly would succeed
      exponentially. But also this depends on what exactly makes a good website
      besides good user interface. As Berners mentions is that “a user doesn’t
      have to have and extensive knowledge about interface to be able to use
      it”. And I down to notice that the longer you spend on the internet or the
      Web is that you can seemingly use any form or website as long as you have
      interacted with another the navigation becomes easier.</p>
      <p class="one"> I can navigate
      through most ensures because of that, websites are more or less similar in
      how to navigate through them. At the end I am the reading Berners mentions
      what is expected from the future in terms of technology and software. Such
      as “virtual reality, teleconferencing, the ability for companies to create
      websites for profit and to be able to find documents based on their
      names”.And it is amazing to see how the ideas or thoughts put out by
      Berner are now a reality. Lol such as virtual reality and
      teleconferencing. Business crest websites and you now have online
      shopping. And I would assume these are the kind of things that Berner
      wanted to see prepared out of the World Wide Web.</p>
