      Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and
      mapping of the geographies of information by Graham et al investigates the
      inequality of access, contribution, and representation amongst the
      internet. The reading does this by explaining visual representation with
      the use of maps to indicate the numbers of internet access, contribution,
      and representation on the internet. In this instance, the map itself stays
      the say but the alterations are done on the map are ever-changing. This
      form of a display according to the writing is an example of (im)mutable
      augmentations which is defined as something that does not change but with
      changing situations.</p> 
      <p class="five"><b>Introduction: </b></p> 
     <p class="five"> According to Graham et al information
      has always had geography it comes from someplace and evolves someplace,
      and information is widely influenced by the place that is created. And
      therefore, the politics and power dynamics are dependent on and influenced
      by the information created in that place. Although the information is
      mobile, once it is moved around it is bound to change due to its change of
      location to suit the place that it is now currently in. As information
      moves around and is exposed to new places it is bound to evolve and
      change. “It is precisely this mobility and adaptability of information
      that provides the motivation to constrain the mutability of information
      through the creation of what Latour (1986) refers to as ‘immutable
      mobiles’: or information that can be transported without significant
      change to its inherent characteristics or meaning.” (Graham et al, 2015
      p89) According to Graham et al immutable mobiles are physical indicators
      of information such as a book that contains information that can’t be
      altered through distribution, the information encoded onto the object
      maintains its influence from where it originated with little to no changes
      after being distributed. ICTs have established the development of
      information through (im)mutable augmentations “characterized by the
      layering of dynamic information across and over geographic space. Thus,
      not only does information have geographies, but geography itself is
      layered, defined, and augmented by information that is more or less
      immutable”(Graham et al, 2015 p89) Graham et al argues that (im)mutable
      augmentations of information about places are important because they
      influence how we can find and understand different parts of the world.
      Because if a location such as a restaurant is omitted from a map it can
      simply cease to exist because people can’t find it and you cannot know or
      go-to place that you don’t even know exists and aren’t sure about its
      location either. Geographic augmentations are therefore much more than
      just representations of places but form as part of the place and become a
      reflection of it and shape it as well. Information is power according to
      the article “the ‘geography of information’ – the geographic distribution
      of information either as a phenomenon in its own right or as
      representative of some other underlying process (Wilson 2015) – has long
      been a key means of control and power formation.” (Graham et al, 2015 p89)</p>
      <p class="five"><b>Digital pieces of Information:</b></p> 
      <p class="five"> Before the takeover of the digital
      age, information was limited and the creation, access, and distribution of
      information were held by a small group of people. Access to information
      was controlled by those who displayed it and can understand it. It was
      mainly only available to those who had a specific skillset in how to
      store, create, organize and catalogue information at a large scale. And
      due to how the world worked at the time information was commonly
      controlled by the global North therefore creating a lack of access,
      creation, and storage of information in the South.</p> 
      <p class="five"><b>Changing geographies
      after the Information revolution:</b></p> <p class="five">The rise of the digital age however has
      allowed many people across the globe to have the freedom to access,
      create, store, and distribute information. Although just because this is
      an option it is, however, not available to everyone due to geographical
      circumstances. This article aims to investigate how the global populace
      alters how information is shared, accessed, and created. </p>
      <p class="five"><b>Through these
      three topics:</b></p> 
      <p class="five">1) Geographies of Access and Enablement</p> 
      <p class="five">2) Geographies of
      Participation</p> 
      <p class="five">3) Geographies of Representation</p> 
      <p class="five"><b>Geographies of Access and
      Enablement:</b></p> 
      <p class="five">This topic refers to the number of people per country that
      have access to the internet and is represented through an augmented map.
      The size of each country represented is determined by its population of
      internet users. The shading of each country represents its internet
      penetration rate the dark shades indicate a higher penetration rate than
      those shaded light. Overall, the map demonstrates a high use of internet
      users in the North compared to the South. The article has also noted that
      the lack of internet access in the South is due to income and the high
      prices placed on internet access compared to that of the North, therefore,
      hindering access.</p> 
      <p class="five"><b>Geographies of Participation:</b></p>
       <p class="five">Another vital aspect of
      accessing digital information is participation. The article measures
      internet participation through firstly domain names which shows that a
      large portion of domain names is distributed in the North. Which has been
      classified that the reason might be because in the South some countries
      have strict restrictions on registering domain names. Secondly, the
      article uses Guthub as this is a very large platform on which internet
      users can publish, contribute, and edit work. And this relates to
      collaborative coding and again the article shows that the North had more
      Github commits than the South. The third aspect is Wikipedia
      contributions, as Wikipedia is widely known to allow people to be able to
      edit and contribute to the site. But information suggests that Africa has
      one of the lowest contributions to Wikipedia.</p> 
      <p class="five"><b>Geographies of
      Representation:</b></p> 
      <p class="five">This topic aims to show places that are represented and
      underrepresented in the digital world. The article makes use of data taken
      from Google search data which yielded similar results to those discussed
      above. That the North yields more results than the South.</p> 
      <p class="five"><b>Conclusion:</b></p> 
      <p class="five">The
      article in conclusion has brought to my attention that not all places have
      the same access to the internet due to geographical circumstances. But the
      internet is excluding certain parts of the world and not making it easy
      for them to gain access. But the way the internet is set up isn’t entirely
      the reason to blame but the way things have been generated from the start
      where the North has always had the power and still maintains it. The South
      is trying to catch up but circumstances in those places don’t make it easy
      as well as the power dynamics and dictatorship of some countries where
      sometimes the internet is prohibited or prices to access the internet are
      high and form an unnecessary expense to some people who cannot afford it.</p>
