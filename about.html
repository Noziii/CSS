      <p class="one">
        I'm <strong>Nozipho Sithole</strong> I am 21 years old. I was born and
        raised in South Africa and i am currently still based here in the city
        of Johannesburg. I am currently studying at The University of the
        Witwatersrand in my 3rd year majoring in <em>Animation</em> and
        <em>Interactive Media</em>. Since 2019 up until January 2022 i have
        worked for a sneaker retail store called <em>Shesha</em> as a sales
        person and then later as a cashier and secondary assistant manager. This
        job over the years has helped me develop good peoeple skills and
        customer service. The job taught me how to deal with and approach
        customers and more importantly how to sell an idea to a customer. Coming
        out of this job i have learnt how to handle difficult situations with
        customers such as when they are unhappy about a product, by negotiating
        and offering alternatives which are in the best interest of both the
        company and the customer.
