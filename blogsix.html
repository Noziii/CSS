        For my external JavaScript, I chose to implement the side scroll gallery
        which I implemented onto my portfolio page. The reason why I chose to
        implement the side scroll gallery is to optimize the usage of the whole
        screen. According to an article on Slider revolution side scroll and
        horizontal layout is good for presenting image content. (Staff, 2022)
        And my portfolio is all image-based the large scale of the images makes
        them more eligible and prevents users from having to squint to see the
        images. The side scroll gallery is also beneficial in that it provides
        the best possible use of screen space, and it also provides a smoother
        flow of representation. The horizontal gallery is also good for
        secondary information, such as images, horizontal scrolling lets the
        user see a small sample of the content and click for more. This also
        helps to save vertical screen space instead of displaying my images on a
        long vertical page. (Beware Horizontal Scrolling and Mimicking Swipe on
        Desktop, n.d.)

        The horizontal gallery creates a better user experience as it gives a
        different and more intriguing type of design and choice of layout making
        it more exciting for the user. The user doesn’t have to scroll down a
        long stack of images where some might not be visible. The alternative
        option was to have a static group gallery where I have a collage of
        images for my portfolio all stacked next to, on top, or beneath each
        other, all in different sizes but this will make it difficult for users
        to see the images, a horizontal gallery with overlays this wasn’t too
        bad but when I had implemented it the images looked clustered, and the
        page felt somewhat empty. I chose the horizontal gallery because I
        believe it helps to display the images at their full capacity and makes
        for good interaction and offers a different interaction from my other
        pages where the user scrolls vertically to look through the information
        and they make use of the full desktop screen page. It also has a very
        simple and clean aesthetic that ties in well with the rest of the
        website.
