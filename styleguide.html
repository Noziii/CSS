      <p class="one"><strong>Fonts:</strong></p>
      <p class="two">Lucida handrwiting</p>
      <p class="three">Open Sans</p>
      <p class="four">
        The reason why I chose these fonts is that Open sans firstly is a very
        simple and legible font. It is not hard to read therefore making it
        accessible to people who might have eyesight problems. I have made most
        of the headings big in size, and all text is presented in a fairly
        reasonable size font. Lucida’s handwriting on the other mimics that of
        cursive handwriting and is also not hard to read either. I added in the
        Lucida handwriting for the secondary headings and some labelling for
        images. I added the Lucida font to give a different dynamic to the text
        on the pages instead of having the same font because this can cause a
        page to be flat and not aesthetically pleasing. The smallest details can
        sometimes make the the biggest difference and this added some
        personality to my page. This essentially is what I am trying to get
        across to my viewer because this is my portfolio website by me. All text
        represented on my web pages is vast in colour in comparison to its
        background this also makes it easier for the viewer to read the text.
        The viewer of my website should not have a difficult time trying to read
        and understand the text on the pages because this can put them off and
        lead them to be disinterested in further engaging with my site.

      <p class="five"><strong>Colour Palette:</strong></p>
      <p class="six">rgba(89, 87, 87, 0.593)</p>
      <p class="seven">rgb(234, 233, 233)</p>
      <p class="eight">black</p>
      <p class="nine">white</p>
      <p class="ten">rgba(53, 52, 52, 0.301)</p>
      <p class="eleven">#aaa</p>
      <p class="tweleve">rgb(78, 75, 75)</p>
      <p class="thirteen">
        My web pages make use of a variety of colours but the most dominant of
        them are dark and light grey, a bit of beige, white, and blush pink here
        and there. My website is made up of a lot of light cold colours. There
        really isn’t a bigger scheme of why I chose this pallet but besides the
        fact that I like them. I have always been fond of neutral colours
        because I find them aesthetically pleasing and calm. So, I decided to
        run with this palette because it communicates and reflects my interests
        and brings my essence of me to life. Apart from me liking the colours
        they also serve well together and are minimalistic. Minimalism is always
        the right way to go as it avoids confusion and I tried not to make use
        of colours that are too contrasting. This can be overbearing for the
        user and make it difficult to focus and sometimes read text on the page.
        I also tried to keep in mind people who might suffer from colour
        blindness and have a hard time seeing certain colours.

      <p class="fourteen"><strong>Wireframe:</strong></p>
      <p class="fifteen">
        My wireframes remained fairly the same from the start of the process as
        demonstrated in my wireframes. My wireframes are simple none of the
        pages are overcrowded and they are minimalistic which like I said before
        is timeless. Everything the user needs to engage with is clear and
        because of a user’s previous knowledge from the use of other sites it
        shouldn’t be difficult to navigate through the pages.
