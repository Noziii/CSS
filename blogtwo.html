        A browser is a program on which a user can gain information which is on
        the World Wide Web. A user uses a browser to gain access to items and
        information such as videos, images, etc. The browser is technically a
        program that allows a user to access information online. The browser
        works as a client which is available on the user’s device. The user then
        puts in a request to the web server and the request is then sent back
        and displayed as the information that the user asked for. Browsers are
        therefore presented in everyday apps that we have on our laptops or
        phones such as Safari on iPhone and Google or Chrome on any desktop of a
        laptop. Through Browsers, users have unlimited access to all sorts of
        information made available on the World Wide Web. (What Is a Web
        Browser?, n.d.)

        But how does it work? According to an article on Mozilla a Web browser
        has the ability to take you anywhere on the internet. It fetches
        information from other parts of the web and displays it on your desktop
        or phone. The information is transferred using the Hypertext Transfer
        Protocol which defines how information and items on the web are
        transmitted. When the web browser fetches the information from a server
        it uses a piece of software called a “rendering engine” to translate
        information into text and images. The information is written in
        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and the web browser then read this
        information and presents it as we see it. Hyperlinks permit users to go
        to other pages or sites on the web every item on a webpage has its own
        unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which is also known as a web
        address. When a browser requests information from a server the web
        address tells the browser where to look for it. (What Is a Web Browser?,
        n.d.)

        Writing this piece on web browsers helped me to understand more about
        HTML, URLs, and servers because from the previous weeks’ article by Tim
        Berners-Lee The World Wide Web I found it rather difficult to follow
        along on the terms and what they do. But the research I did and the
        article I found helped to explain the terms better and their functions
        on the internet. I also learned about what cookies do which I think is
        rather fascinating according to the Mozilla article information about a
        person is saved in files called cookies. Now I know that when a website
        says it uses cookies I know exactly what that means that it stores my
        information upon my return to the site.
