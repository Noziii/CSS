          <div class="four">
            <p>In this reflection I will discuss my work and progress for my website by looking at each page and discussing the decisions made and why I made them. For my home page I chose to have a simple background picture that somewhat resonates to my personality and overall aesthetic as a person. I have my name in bold as well as my future occupation. This home page is simple and straight to the point it gives the user my name and field of work so that they immediately know whether I am the right person for the job before going any further. 
            </p>
            <p>The navigation bar on all pages is fixed so that if the user scrolls up the navigation bar always remains in sight. The navigation bar used to move out of sight but from previous evaluation, it was determined that the navigation bar should always be within sight of the user so that no matter where on the page they are, they can still navigate out of the page. 
              <p>My name in bold remains on most pages to keep a constant look and makes it more memorable the more often it is seen. Usually, fonts in large sizes are easy to remember and that’s something I have picked up from looking at numerous websites writing in large fonts is what I usually remember after leaving the site and since this is my job portfolio, I want the user to remember my name.On my about page, I gave a brief description of myself and my experience alongside an image of myself to give the user a personal feel of who I am and what I am about.  The layout is very simple with my text in a container floating to the left spaced out with padding to not make the text feel like it is squashed and therefore making it eligible with line-height.  </p>
            </p>My portfolio page has gone through several transitions from the images displayed just being a static gallery, to interactable images that when you hover over them an overlay will appear with a description of what the image is. But now I chose to display my portfolio in a horizontal slider gallery. The images displayed in my portfolio I merely stock images from Unsplash because I have no complete work of my own that I can currently display. The reason I chose to use a slider gallery is that I didn’t like that the user had to scroll down to view the images but now the images are also in a large scale therefore the user can see it more clearly and all they must do is press the next button to view the next picture with a caption indicating what it is. Compared to the stagnant gallery where the images used to be stacked next to each other this feels more organized. And the real reason I chose the slider gallery is that I think it looks better its more aesthetically pleasing because I didn’t like how cluttered all the images looked placed next to and on top of each other. 
            </p>
            <p>My blog page is also very simply designed my blogs are presented in the form of cards stacked vertically with a hyperlinked image that the user can click on to take them to the blog page they have selected. I also included the date that the blog was written and a heart-like button that is not active because I couldn’t get it to work, but I like the way it looks because it gives the illusion that people have interacted with my blogs. My blog page hasn’t changed much from the start of my website except that I used to have two coloumns of cards for my blogs some floating to the left and the others floating to the right but in assignment 2 I received a comment that said it looks cluttered and so I changed to have them all stacked vertically. But now I feel that there is a lot of unnecessary negative space around the blog cards which makes it look empty.  All my actual blog pages are styled the same with the text in a container and the blog heading at the top, I like the simplistic design of it because the focus is the text, but I still feel like something is missing or feels wrong. All the text floats to the left because the text that floats to the left in the case of my website seems to be more eligible according to people who have interacted with my site. </p>
          <p>My design page is also presented with hyperlink cards that direct the user to my wireframes, style guide and references. All these pages are set up similarly to my other pages my wireframes are presented in a slider gallery because these are images, I took they are more eligible and clear this way. My style guide is text inside containers as well as my references the references page is used to reference all the images i used in my site. Across my website especially my blogs my text was in separate containers which made it look messy but now I put everything in one container with subheadings to make it better organized and less cluttered. 
            All pages have a footer so that the web pages don’t feel endless, and they have my cell number and email address on the footer so they can contact me.
