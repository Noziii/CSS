    </h1>

    <div class="seven">
      <p>
        To analyse my UI And UX I will be using the How to PDF by Peta Golodberg
        alongside my own additional research. First let us look into the laws
        that effect UX according to the How to PDF the first being Von Restorff
        Effect where multiple similar objects are present, one that differs from
        the rest is most likely to be remembered. On my website, I utilized this
        by writing some text in bold for information that I want users to pay
        attention to especially if there is a large sum of writing such as on my
        blog pages and my name across the website is in bold and differs from
        the other texts on the site as well as the headings for the blog pages,
        the font differs from that of the whole blog post itself.

        Fitts’ Law that the time to obtain a point is a function of the distance
        and size of the target. This can relate to my footer which is present on
        all my pages at the bottom and in full capacity of the screen width.
        Because most of my web pages require my user to scroll down my footer is
        easy to find and the user will automatically stumble upon it where they
        can retrieve my email and cell phone number to contact me.
        (Godlberg,2022)

        The next element that I will look at is that of a call to action(CTA)
        this is when a webpage encourages the user to do something. I can say
        that my home page is where CTA comes into play because my homepage is
        more of a bait page that is aesthetically pleasing and makes you want to
        see more. The moment a user opens my site they are placed on the home
        page where they have the navigation bar that can navigate them to other
        pages on my site. The home page, therefore, encourages the user to click
        on the next web page for more information. (Godlberg,2022)

        <strong> Eligible and legibility, readability</strong> refers to the way
        in which large pieces of text are arranged on a page, and legibility
        generally refers to the font and whether the user can make out the
        letters from each other. Throughout my site, all my text is contained
        within borders that have padding to give the text space alongside with
        line-height and they mainly all float to the left and is placed on a
        solid colour background that is lighter in colour compared to the text
        to create a contrast and making sure the text is readable. The font is
        also legible because I made use of Open Sans for mainly the large bodies
        of text and made the font big enough to differentiate the characters.
        Where I made use of more than stylistic font, I made sure to make the
        font big so that it is legible and made sure to use a font that isn’t
        too difficult to read but still looks aesthetically pleasing.

        <strong>Visual weight: </strong> throughout my website I make use of
        symmetrical, asymmetrical, and radial balance where my elements on one
        side of the page have a similar visual weight to the other. Such as on
        my about page where I have my Image on one side and my block of text on
        the other side of the page. The visual weight is not the same but looks
        similar and they manage to balance each other out without one side
        looking disturbingly heavier than the other. I use the symmetrical
        balance on my main blog page where I have all my blog page cards lined
        up in the centre. (Adobe, 2021)

        <strong> Balance and alignment:</strong> alignment is the placing of
        elements so that they align, when components in a site align it makes it
        appear clear, confident, and elegant. Alignment in my website is mainly
        evident when it comes to my text where they all align to the left. At
        the start of creating my website had my text aligned in the middle, but
        many people did not like how it looked and said it was a bit jarring to
        read the text when it aligns in the middle of the page. (Godlberg,2022)

        <strong> Harmony:</strong> I can identify harmony across my whole
        website, harmony is defined as the visually satisfying effect of
        combining alike or related elements. My site is very harmonious using
        the same or similar colour palette on all my pages as well as a
        simplistic layout that is slightly similar throughout. (Godlberg,2022)
        My site makes for simple and easy navigation which creates a good user
        experience as anyone viewing my site doesn’t need to wreck their brain
        searching for something.
