      Accessibility is a very important component to have implemented in one’s
      design of a gadget, website, video game, etc. But in most cases is very
      rarely catered for at all and here I want us to discuss the importance of
      accessibility first let’s talk about what accessibility is and what it
      entails. According to research accessibility is the design of products,
      facilities, vehicles, or environments so they are usable by people with
      disabilities. (Henry et al., 2014) As many of us have seen implementations
      put in place to cater to people with permanent or temporary disabilities
      whether it be a ramp for a wheelchair at the mall, a brail on a
      restaurant’s menu, or a game that caters to colour blind people. These are
      all elements put in to make these services and products accessible to
      everyone. Now, why is accessibility important? Well…. It’s important
      because it allows people who suffer from disabilities to still be able to
      access daily products and services. This stops them from being excluded
      and allows them to lead a normal life without much difficulty. People with
      certain disabilities also need access to necessities such as being able to
      use a phone, elevator, public bathroom, and other necessities and having
      access to the internet, and being able to engage with what is presented in
      front of them. And this makes for an overall good design. But let’s look
      at accessibility in websites, there are several ways in which a website
      can cater to disabled people, the website can make use of certain colours
      which can be identifiable to people who are colour blind. A designer can
      try to avoid communicating important information with just the use of
      colour, or text but rather also use sound, this way the designer is
      catering to people who are blind and /or deaf. Apart from its being
      inclusive accessibility promotes usability, prompting more people to use
      the website because it caters to everyone. And accessibility is apparently
      in the law which is something I did not know and that is another aspect on
      its own that makes it so important.(“Web Accessibility,” 2018)
