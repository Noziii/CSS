        Accessibility is a very important component to have implemented in one’s
        design of a gadget, website, video game, etc. But in most cases is very
        rarely catered for at all and here I want us to discuss the importance
        of accessibility first let’s talk about what accessibility is and what
        it entails. Accessibility is the design of products, facilities,
        vehicles, or environments so they are usable by people with
        disabilities. (Henry et al., 2014) As many of us have seen
        implementations put in place to cater to people with permanent or
        temporary disabilities whether it be a ramp for a wheelchair at the
        mall, a brail on a restaurant’s menu, or a game that caters to colour
        blind people. These are all elements put in to make these services and
        products accessible to everyone. Web accessibility however according to
        an article on the site Web Accessibility Initiative, means that
        websites, tools, and technologies are designed so that people with
        disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can perceive,
        understand, navigate, and interact with the Web and contribute to the
        Web. Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access
        to the Web such as cognitive, physical, speech, visual, auditory, and
        neurological. But web accessibility to people without disabilities such
        as people using different devices with smaller screens, people with
        temporary disabilities, older people with changing abilities due to
        ageing, etc. (Initiative, n.d.)
      </p>

        Now, why is accessibility important? The web forms as an essential
        resource in people’s lives whether it is through education, employment,
        recreation etc. It is important that the web is accessible to provide
        equal access and opportunity to everyone. The article also states that
        access to information and communication technologies, including the Web
        is defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Convention on
        the Rights of Persons with Disabilities(UN CRPD). Accessibility in all
        aspects is important as to not exclude people with disabilities and
        those without. (Initiative, n.d.)
      </p>

        There are several ways in which a website can cater to disabled people,
        the website can make use of certain colours which can be identifiable to
        people who are colour blind. A designer can try to avoid communicating
        important information with just the use of colour, or text but rather
        also use sound, this way the designer is catering to people who are
        blind and /or deaf. Apart from its being inclusive accessibility
        promotes usability, prompting more people to use the website because it
        caters to everyone. (“Web Accessibility,” 2018) Apart from creating an
        accessible website, a designer needs to evaluate its accessibility and
        this is mainly done successfully through human evaluation. (Initiative,
        n.d.)
